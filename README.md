# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

Here is a random password generator that allows the user to determine password length and the characters types included in the password. 

## How it Works
```
Upon opening the browser, users will be asked if they are ready to begin password creation. 
Then they are prompted to input their desired number of characters in the password. 
Then they are prompted to choose among lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and/or special characters to be included in the password. 

```
Once the character number and types are chosen, users will click the "Generate Password" button, and their password will appear in the generator box.
